## What is C4 Model?

The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a lightweight and practical approach for visualizing the architecture of a software system.  
It was developed by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/), a seasoned software architect and consultant.  
C4 provides a set of diagrams that enable software architects and developers to communicate and document the structure, key elements, and interactions of the system.

If you never heard about C4 - check the [C4 Model website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.


## What is LikeC4? Why "like"?

C4 is great. But sometimes we want to go beyond four levels, we want custom ones with our semantics.  
This is where LikeC4 comes in. It allows to customize and tailor architecture model to our needs.  
And customization is essential for Architecture-as-a-Code approach.
